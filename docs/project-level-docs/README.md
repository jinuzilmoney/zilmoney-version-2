# Project-Level Documentation

This folder stores **top-level documentation** related to the project. Use this for high-level guides and standards that apply across the entire codebase.

## What belongs here

- Project rules and conventions that the team must follow
- Details about common/shared components and how to use them
- Design system guidelines (typography, colors, spacing, etc.)
- API conventions and data-fetching patterns
- Folder structure and architectural decisions
- Coding standards and naming conventions
- Environment setup and configuration guides

## Guidelines

- Keep documents focused on a single topic
- Update docs when the related code changes
- This is NOT for feature-specific documentation — use `docs/feature-level-docs/` for that
