# Coding Rules

Rules that every team member must follow before pushing code.

## Before Committing

1. **Remove all `console.log` statements** used for debugging. Do not leave any debug logs in the committed code.
2. **Fix all linting errors** in every file you modified or created. Run the linter and resolve all warnings/errors before committing.
3. **Format your code using Prettier**. Use a common file formatter (Prettier) to ensure consistent formatting across the codebase. Format all modified/created files before committing.
